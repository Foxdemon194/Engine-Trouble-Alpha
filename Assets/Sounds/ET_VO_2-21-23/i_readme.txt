If you're reading this, you're implementing sound. I realized that last time, aside from splicing together some lines, 
I didn't give the sounds names to make it clearer as to what exactly they are. At the time, I felt it wasn't necessary, 
seeing as they're in order, numerically. Still, I recognize my sin and am now repenting. The remaining lines for level 1
are titled similarly to the ones of the previous pack, and are in order. Everything else (the line that should play at the start of
each following level, lines that should play when there's a power outage, etc.) are aptly titled. Godspeed.
